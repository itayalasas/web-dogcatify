  # Sync Bookings with Confirmed Orders
  
  ## Problem:
  Bookings remain in "pending" status even though their associated orders are "confirmed".
  This happens when payments are processed through MercadoPago webhooks.
  
  ## Solution:
  1. **Data Fix**: Update all bookings that have confirmed orders but pending status
  2. **Trigger**: Create a trigger to automatically sync booking status when order status changes
  
  ## Changes Made:
  
  1. Data Synchronization
     - Updates all bookings with pending status that have confirmed orders
     - Copies payment details from orders to bookings
  
  2. New Trigger Function
     - `sync_booking_status_on_order_update()`: Automatically updates booking status when order changes
  
  3. New Trigger
     - Fires AFTER UPDATE on orders table
     - Syncs booking status, payment_status, and payment_method with order
  
  ## Security:
  - Trigger runs as SECURITY DEFINER to ensure proper permissions
  - Only syncs when order status actually changes
